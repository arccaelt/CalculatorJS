A calculator written in vanilla JS + HTML/CSS(no frameworks) that has 2 modes:
  1. Basic = with the bare metal functionality of a calculator
  2. Advanced = that provides some additional features, like: exponentiation, trig functions, factorials etc.
  
Under the hood, the "app" transforms the expression into RPN(Reverse Polish Notation) and uses a stack to evaluate it.
Also, the code tries to be as polymorphic as possible.
